  <title>Short tutorial on groups</title>
  <text>
Access to documents within the DocDB is controlled in several ways. A document
may be tagged as accessible to a subset of groups. Additionally, each group may
have a list of subordinate groups. Anything marked viewable by a subordinate is
also viewable by its superior group. (This relationship does not extend to more
than one generation, though.)<p/> Each group also has a flag determining
whether that group is allowed to create new  or modify existing documents. If a
group is in the list of those allowed to modify a  document, it can change that
document (assuming they also have the create/modify flag set). These group
names must match those in the <b>.htpasswd</b> file although the comparison is
not case sensitive.

<key>wordsearch</key>
<title>Text Searches</title>
  <text>
These fields allow you to search on the various text items in the database.
The following modes are used to search for information:
<ul>
 <li><b>Any words as sub-string: </b>The information you enter is broken into
 words (delimited by spaces) and the field you are searching in is required to
 match one or more of these words as a sub-string (<i>lock</i> will match
 <i>lock</i> and <i>block</i>).</li>
 <li><b>All words as sub-string: </b>The information you enter is broken into
 words (delimited by spaces) and the field you are searching in is required to
 match all of these words as sub-strings (in any order).</li>
 <li><b>Any or all words as words: </b>Like the searches above, but spaces are
 require to delimit words (<i>lock</i> will not match <i>block</i>).</li>
</ul>
  </text>
 </entry>

<entry>
 <key>contentsearch</key>
 <title>File content search</title>
 <text>
  This field uses an external search engine to search for strings in the files
  in the document. Whether it matches sub-strings or whole words is a function
  of the external search engine. Note that not all document formats are
  searchable. (Searches in text and HTML files will be most reliable.)
  </text>

 <entry>
<key>logictype</key>
<title>Between Fields vs. Within Fields</title>
  <text>
Two types of logic can be used to refine your search. <p/>

The setting for <b>Between Fields</b> lets you select AND or OR between
elements on the form. For instance, if you select and Author and a Topic, you
can either find documents by that author AND on that topic or by that author OR
on that topic. AND is the default.<p/>

The setting for <b>Within Fields</b> determines what happens when, for instance,
you select two authors. You can either require that both authors are present on
the paper (AND) or either author is present (OR). OR is the
default. Note that this setting
doesn't apply to text searches (since they use their own syntax). Also, for
Submitter and Document Type, multiple settings on the document are not
possible, so these searches are <b>always</b> done with an OR.

 <entry>
<key>keywords</key>
<title>Keywords</title>
  <text>
   Keywords are used to further classify documents below the sub-topic level.

<key>replacefiles</key>
<title>Replace Duplicate Files</title>

If you select this option, any files you add which duplicate file names of
existing files will completely replace the old files (no backup will be kept).
Do <strong>not</strong> use this option to avoid creating a new version of a
document, even if only minor changes have been made. This option is, instead,
intended for making minor fixes to presentation formats and the like.  Disk
space is cheap, mistakes are not.

  <title>Ordered Author List</title>
  <text>
   <p>Type the names of the authors <strong>in order</strong> here. Put each
   author on a new line. Use first names or initials and full last names. Each
   author entered will checked against the database and a <b>unique</b> match
   must be found for <strong>all</strong> authors before the document will be
   added. Requiring a unique match means that for people who share a last name and initial,
   the first name must be fully specified. Entered middle initials are
   ignored.</p>
   <p>This will create an ordered author list. If you normally enter authors
   from  a selectable list and you instead see the text entry box, that means
   the list was already ordered by someone else.</p>
   <p>If you would prefer to select the author names from a list, click on
   "Select from list" or choose "Selectable List" as the author selection mode
   from the advanced form on the DocDB Changes page. Switching list styles
   will not preserve changes just made and the list style will erase any
   ordering of the authors.</p>
      <p>The DCC recognizes both "Active" authors (current LSC/Virgo members) and "All"
         authors (anyone who has authored a document in the DCC). You can select in the
            "Preferences" page which list to be used, where you can choose which

<ol>
<li>Reserve a document #: Select this option if you want a number for a document
you are going to write, but don't have a draft of the document.</li>
<li>New document: You have a new document ready to be put into the database that
has not been entered before.</li>
<li>Update document: You have a new version of a document already in the
database. You will also be able to change any of the information in the database
about the document. You must supply a document number to modify.</li>
<li>Update database information: The document hasn't changed, but the
information about it has. For example, it's now published so you want to add that
information. You must supply a document number to modify.</li>
<li>Add/Replace files: You forgot a file that belongs with the document or
something minor has changed in one of the files.<p/>Replacing files should be done
with caution since no backup is kept. Please do not use this capability to
avoid creating a new version of a document when that is more appropriate. Disk

  <title>File upload</title>
  <text>
This field will upload a file from your local computer to the database server.
Usually you will press the "Browse" button to select, from your local file
system, the file to be uploaded. The base file name cannot contain a back slash
"\" or a forward slash "/" to preserve compatibility with both Windows and
Unix.
<p/>
You can also enter a short description of each file, which will appear in the
summary of the document. The description is optional.
<p/>
If there are more upload boxes than you need, just leave the last ones blank.
<p/>
If you want to submit a URL rather than a local file, use the Customize
Insert/Modify functions to select your type of upload.

   this document. These documents will be listed in the display of this one,
   and this document will be listed in the display of the entered documents. A
   document # by itself will refer to all versions of that document, a document
   ID like 123-v4 will refer only to the specified version. A document ID like
   FOO-123-v4 will refer to version 4 of document 123 for project FOO. Consult
   your DocDB admins  to find out what other projects' DocDBs you can link to
   this way. <p/>

  <title>Force Delete</title>
  <text>
   Checking this box will force DocDB to take the administration action
   regardless of the consequences. Doing this may have unintended consequences
   or leave the DB in an incoherent state. For instance, deleting a topic will
   cause its sub-topics to also be deleted and may leave some documents without
   any topics.

   For each document, select the fields you want displayed and their position.
   For instance, column 2 row 1 will be to the right of column 1, row 1 while
   column 1, row 2 will be displayed below. The Row(s) and Column(s) settings
   allow larger fields to span several rows or  columns (these are equivalent to
   rowspan and colspan in HTML.)  If not laid out correctly, this can
   cause strange looking lists.

         Specify how many levels of related documents should be present.
         A depth of 1 prints the same result as this document's original related

         document's related documents as well as their related documents.
    </p>
    <p>
        The lowest you can go is 1. Any numbers entered less than that will show
        the same result as depth 1.

<title>What is MathJax ?</title>
  <text>
<p>From the MathJax project documentation [1] :
<q>MathJax is an open-source JavaScript display engine for LaTeX, MathML, and AsciiMath notation that works in all modern browsers. </q>
</p>
<p>
It is an APi that is activated in the document pages of DCC, detects chunks of valid latex expression and renders them properly.
For instance:<br /> \frac{1}{\Bigl(\sqrt{\phi \sqrt{5}}-\phi\Bigr) e^{\frac25 \pi}} \equiv 1+\frac{e^{-2\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-4\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-6\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-8\pi}} {1+\cdots} } } }
<br />
will look something like this:
</p>
\[\frac{1}{\Bigl(\sqrt{\phi \sqrt{5}}-\phi\Bigr) e^{\frac25 \pi}} \equiv 1+\frac{e^{-2\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-4\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-6\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-8\pi}} {1+\cdots} } } } \]

<strong>How to create Math expression or Symbols in Latex</strong>

<p>
To insert LaTeX code:
<ul>
<li>
inline with <code>\( .. \)</code>  \(
\frac{1}{\Bigl(\sqrt{\phi \sqrt{5}}-\phi\Bigr) e^{\frac25 \pi}} \equiv 1+\frac{e^{-2\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-4\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-6\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-8\pi}} {1+\cdots} } } }
\)
</li>
<li>
as block with <code>\[ .. \]</code> \[\frac{1}{\Bigl(\sqrt{\phi \sqrt{5}}-\phi\Bigr) e^{\frac25 \pi}} \equiv 1+\frac{e^{-2\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-4\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-6\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-8\pi}} {1+\cdots} } } } \]
</li>
<li>
<code> $ .. $ </code>  is not interpreted as LaTex:  $\frac{1}{\Bigl(\sqrt{\phi \sqrt{5}}-\phi\Bigr) e^{\frac25 \pi}} \equiv 1+\frac{e^{-2\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-4\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-6\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-8\pi}} {1+\cdots} } } }$
</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>At this time we have not installed mathjax extension or LaTex aliases. The recommended Latex code for the Solar Mass symbol it M_{\odot}</p>
