<title>DCC Released to LIGO Lab</title>
</head>

<h2>The new DCC is open for all LSC documents as of Jan 26, 2009.</h2>
A new Document Control Center (DCC) will be open for use by the LSC on Jan 26, 2009. This is the central repository that the collaboration should use to share, archive, and otherwise manage documents related to LIGO activities.  Note this new system is also open for members of Virgo to collaborate on LIGO related documents.
<p>
Please start using this new system after Jan 26 for all your LIGO documents, whether creating an updated version of an old document in the previous system or creating a new document. One week after this release, on Feb 2, we will shutdown access to create new documents in the old DCC.
<p>
There will be a 1 hour demo/Q&A session on Monday (Jan 26) from 8AM to 9AM PST
given by Stuart Anderson, Melody Araya, Cleveland Mak, and  Calum Torrie for anyone interested.
This will be held in the SCR at Caltech using webcam XP to share the demo desktop
and a standard conference number for remote participation. In
particular, the webcamXP address will be,
<a href="http://131.215.115.187:8080">http://131.215.115.187:8080</a>
and the phone number will be 1-800-704-9896 (US/Canada) 1-404-920-6472 (International) (85575167#). If toll-free International numbers are setup in time they will be posted at the bottom of this page. If this call is useful, but turns out to be an inconvenient time for a significant number of people we will schedule an additional session.
<p>
<h2>Highlights of the new system:</h2>
<dl>
<dt><dd><img src="dot1.gif"> Documents can contain multiple files, e.g., both an original electronics drawing or power point source file, as well as a rendered pdf version.

<dt><dd><img src="dot1.gif"> Each document and user is given an access group for reading and modifying from the following hierarchy of groups:
<pre>
	- public (View option only, no option for group public creating or modifying documents)
	- LVC
	- LSC
	- LIGO Lab
	- LIGO Lab Business
	- LIGO Lab Management
	- LIGO Lab Directorate
</pre>

<dt><dd><img src="dot1.gif"> Documents are immediately visible to members of the specified access group (or higher) once they are uploaded, with the exception of public access to public documents which requires human approval first.

<dt><dd><img src="dot1.gif"> No special software is required to use the new DCC, just a modern web browser.

<dt><dd><img src="dot1.gif"> Links can be made directly to individual files in a document to bypass the DCC web site, e.g., building your own web page that links to several files/documents.

<dt><dd><img src="dot1.gif"> You can search for documents based on the content of individual files as well as metadata such as the title.

<dt><dd><img src="dot1.gif"> Documents can be linked and grouped in a few interesting ways, e.g.,
a prototype of how LIGO presentations for the current GWDAW meeting can be
<a href="https://dcc.ligo.org/cgi-bin/private/DocDB/DisplayMeeting?conferenceid=10">grouped together</a>.

<dt><dd><img src="dot1.gif"> You can sign up for email notification of additions or modifications to documents that you are interested in.
</dl>

<h2>Accessing the new system:</h2>
<p>
To access the new DCC you will need to use your LIGO.ORG account. This
is the account that is used for web sites that present
<tt>"albert.einstein"</tt>
as an example in a pop-up window when you first try to access them. If
you have not used this account before, please visit <a
href="http://roster.ligo.org">http://roster.ligo.org</a>
and verify you have an account and can login, or to request a new password if you have forgotten your original one.
<p>
To get started with the new DCC please visit
<a href="http://dcc.ligo.org">http://dcc.ligo.org</a>. A few useful links are,

<dl>
<dt><dd><img src="dot1.gif"> The private section of the DCC, i.e., page for accessing all non-public documents,
<a href="https://dcc.ligo.org/cgi-bin/private/DocDB/DocumentDatabase">https://dcc.ligo.org/cgi-bin/private/DocDB/DocumentDatabase</a>

<dt><dd><img src="dot1.gif"> Getting Started at
<a href="https://dcc.ligo.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">https://dcc.ligo.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page</a>

<dt><dd><img src="dot1.gif"> email for help at
<a href="mailto:dcc-help@ligo.org">dcc-help@ligo.org</a>
</dl>

Please note that if you are running a Windows operating system and using the native web browser (Internet Explorer) you may be asked to login twice. This Microsoft feature can be fixed by the following steps. Note, this will also help with viewing other web sites that have switched over to using LIGO.ORG accounts, i.e., web sites that have the example "albert.einstein" in the pop-up login window:
<pre>
1. In Internet Explorer, click Tools, and then click Internet Options.
2. Click the Advanced tab.
3. Scroll down to the Security section.
4. Make sure that Enable Integrated Windows Authentication* is unchecked, and then click OK.
5. Restart IE.
</pre>
<p>
<h2>Transition plan:</h2>
<p>
Shortly after the new DCC is open to the full LSC and Virgo collaborations there will be three further steps to finish the transition from the old to the new DCC:
<dl>
<dt><dd><img src="dot1.gif"> The old system will first be frozen in a read-only state to prevent further updates.

<dt><dd><img src="dot1.gif"> All documents from the old system will be migrated to the new system (and be stored in version "-x0" documents in the new system). This is expected to take several Months.

<dt><dd><img src="dot1.gif"> Release to the public. The public interface for access to public documents without having to login with a LIGO.ORG account is not fully implemented yet.
