<h2>DCC version 2.2.0 was released on May 7, 2009.</h2>

In addition to a few <a href="https://dcc.ligo.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=142">bug fixes</a> this DCC release adds the following functionality. If you have any questions please contact <a href="mailto:dcc-help@ligo.org">dcc-help@ligo.org</a>.
<p>
<dl>
<dt><dd><img src="dot1.gif"> <a href="https://dcc.ligo.org/cgi-bin/private/DocDB/ListAuthorGroups">Author groups</a> may now be selected for large author documents, e.g., a publication for the LSC and Virgo collaborations. The new author groups may be selected in addition to individual authors, but are not required. However, at least one author for each document is required so either at least one individual or one group of authors must be selected. The initial list of author groups is LSC and LVC. Note, the membership of these groups is the current membership of these collaborations and not the more restrictive list of authors for formal external publications.
<p>
Please note that a search for documents by author will match documents based on author group membership by default, e.g., if the author being searched for is an LSC member than all documents that have LSC listed as an author group will match. To perform a more restirctive search that only matches documents where a given author is explicitly listed you should un-select the option: <tt>Include Author Groups</tt>.

<dt><dd><img src="dot1.gif"> Access to documents, either viewing or modifying, may be granted based on the author list for a particular document. Note, this is enabled by default, i.e., newly created documents will by default have the author list selected for Viewing and Modifying that documents.
<p>
<dt><dd><img src="dot1.gif"> Additional access groups that are not part of the <a href="https://dcc.ligo.org/wiki/index.php?title=Onion">original group hierarchy</a> have been added with more to come.
</dl>

Please also consider the following two operational recommendations:
<p>
Most internal scientific discussions (instrumental or astrophysical) should be marked for Viewing by the group LVC to share with both the LSC and Virgo collaborations unless it really is private content that should be restricted to a smaller group. For example, many G- presentation documents during the last L-V meeting where mistakenly left as viewable by only the group LSC. A future enhancement to the DCC will attempt to improve the accuracy of the default access settings for new documents.
<p>
The new authorship groups should not be used for every document. For example, most (if not all) technical working group documents should be marked as Viewable by the group LVC, however, not everyone in the LVC needs to be listed as an author.
