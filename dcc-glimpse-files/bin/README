The file prefilter.tcl and the files with names beginning
with "glimpse" are the workhorse scripts of the shadowing
and indexing system.

The incremental indexer now leverages the full power of
prefilter.tcl to index many types of binary file.

Packages required by prefilter.tcl:

 xpdf
 catdoc (and catppt and xls2csv from the catdoc package)
 hdf5 (specifically, h5dump)
 readpdf (a script is provided to install it from source) 
 ghostscript (ps2ascii)
 unzip

Deprecated November 2012:

The other files are utilities mostly used by the incremental
"safety net" indexer. They are called directly by glimpse
using the rules in the files in the glimpse_filters
directory.
